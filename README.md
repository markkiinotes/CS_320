In This reflection I will address everything learned as a tester. I found that the best way to ensure code is secure and functional is to conduct J Unit testing. These tests much cover a variety of scenarios to cover possible incorrect data entries by users.

The best way to determine the needs of a users is to listen to the needs during the interview process. We can also ask good questions to pull the information from the user. When we get that information we can approash the design with test case before writing code. Once we have taken the test cases to the point of completion we can then begin writing the code. This would be the best was to approach the designing and development of the software.
